        <p id = "para"> Basketball is a game which requires immense concentration  , skill, and teamwork skills. It is a great way of having fun and keeping fit .  Playing basketball can also increase one's height and increases the flexibility of the wrist . It's played in a huge area of around 91 x 50 feet . Five players usually play the game . The game uses the person's skills of dribbling , shooting , running and jumping . A player scores a point by shooting from either outside the 3-pointer line (otherwise known as the 3p line) or inside it . Shooting from outside the 3p line gives 3 points to the team , and gives 2 points if shot from inside the line . If any foul is made , the other team gets a free chance to score . It lasts of 4 quarters each of 12 minutes , the team having the most points wins. If the score in the end is tied , something called as "overtime" occurs , in which the teams get additional time to score more points.
